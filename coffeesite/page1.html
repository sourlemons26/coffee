<div class="steptitle"> THE SEED </div>
<div class="stepdescription"> First, seeds of the coffee tree (which is a tropical evergreen shrub)
    are planted. The plant yields berries that are similar to cherries in that they have a
    small seed in the middle â€“ and this seed is what we know as the coffee bean!  A coffee
    tree takes about 5 years to fully develop, and it must be grown in specific conditions and
    soil, hence the majority of coffee being grown in South America/the Caribbean</div>
